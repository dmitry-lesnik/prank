\title{Difference between WKB and time-domain integration methods}

\maketitle



We shall consider spherically symmetric metrics which can be written (in $3+1$- space-time dimensions) in the following form

\begin{equation}\label{MT}
ds^2 = A(r) dt^2 + B(r) d r^2 + r^2 (d \theta^2 + \sin^2 \theta d \phi^2).
\end{equation}

In higher than $D>4$ dimensions, the 2-sphere is replaced by a $D-2$-sphere. Then, we shall consider fields of various spin (scalar ($s=0$), electromagnetic ($s=1$), Dirac ($s=\pm1/2$)).

\begin{equation}\label{wavelike}
\frac{d^{2} \Psi_{i}}{d r_{*}^{2}} + (\omega^{2} - V_{i}(r))\Psi_{i} =
0,\qquad d r_{*}= (A(r) B(r))^{-1/2} dr,
\end{equation}

The "tortoise" coordinate $r^*$ spans from $- \infty$ (black hole horizon) to $+ \infty$ (spacial infinity). Sometimes the space cannot be extended to infinity but to some other, distant cosmological horizon. The effective potential usually has the form of a smooth potential barrier with a peak at about 1.5 of the event horizon (from the origin).

$begin_section{conclusion1}
    Trump's proposal for a "total and complete shutdown" of Muslims entering the US came after last week's deadly shooting in San Bernardino, California by a Muslim couple believed to have been radicalized by extremists.
    
    But Muslim leaders across the US -- including those viewed as US allies -- warn that the Republican candidate's rhetoric could further radicalize disaffected individuals as well as provoke attacks.

$begin_section{conclusion2}
    Most US Muslims have arrived in the US in recent decades, making them a relatively fresh immigrant group. Many say they are watching the billionaire real estate mogul-turned-reality TV star-turned rising political star with alarm.
