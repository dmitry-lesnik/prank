**value_is_growing
<<Next we observe that>> $p1 <<raises>> in the interval from $p2 to $p3.
Notice that on the interval [$p2, $p3] $p1 is <<growing>>.


**value_is_decreasing
<<Next we observe that>> $p1 <<decreases>> in the interval from $p2 to $p3.
It turns out that on the interval [$p2, $p3] $p1 is <<decreasing>>.
