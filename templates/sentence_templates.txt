**value_is_growing
<<Next we observe that>> $_p1 <<raises>> in the interval from $_p2 to $_p3.
Notice that on the interval [$_p2, $_p3] $_p1 is <<growing>>.


**value_is_decreasing
<<Next we observe that>> $_p1 <<decreases>> in the interval from $_p2 to $_p3.
It turns out that on the interval [$_p2, $_p3] $_p1 is <<decreasing>>.

**monotonicity_+
The $_p1 is monotonically increasing on the entire range of the parameter.

**monotonicity_-
The $_p1 is monotonically decreasing on the entire range of the parameter.

**monotonicity_+-
The $_p1 is monotonically increasing until $P1 \approx $_p2$ and then it is decreasing.

**monotonicity_-+
